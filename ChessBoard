Take a number of pictures with a stereo camera in which a chessboard is
visible to both cameras. The program waits until a chessboard is detected in
both camera frames. The pictures are then saved to a file in the specified
output folder. After five seconds, the cameras are rescanned to find another
chessboard perspective. This continues until the specified number of pictures
has been taken.
